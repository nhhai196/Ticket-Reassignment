I. Data structures
	1. Tuple: Contract(family, bundle, price)
		- Bundle and price are vectors of length equal to the number of games
		- If family val < 0, the contract corresponds to a slack variable of game or family (-family val)

	2. Order of a row over columns:
		- A game-row:  
		- A family-row:

II. Main functions:
	1. Scarf Pivoting:
		a.  Cardinal Pivoting: take a basis j_1, j_2, ..., j_n and j* 
		- Input: a list of Contracts (a cardinal basis) and a Contract (pushed in)
		- Output: a new list of contract (new basis) and a Contract (kicked out) 

		b. Ordinal Pivoting: 
		- Input: a list of Contracts (an ordinal basis) and a Contract(kicked out)
		- Ouput: a list of Contracts (new basis) and a Contract (pushed in)

	2. Iterative Rounding
